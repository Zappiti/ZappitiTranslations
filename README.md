Translations for Zappiti coming version (v3.1)
===================

Hi everyone,

Many people asked me how they can help to translate Zappiti. So I just created a git repository for them.
I also join a tool (Translator.exe) that should be use to update the translations files in a convenient way.
Feel free to contribute if you want to add a new language or correct existing translations.

This would be greatly appreciated.

I also add translation for Android app, in the Andoid folder.
